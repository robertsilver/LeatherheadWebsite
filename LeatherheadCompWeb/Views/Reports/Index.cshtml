    <h1>Edward Noyce Tribute Day - 15th June 2014 (Through one man’s eyes.  Harry Ferris.)</h1>
    <p>
        It hardly seems possible that it is once again time to pay our annual tribute to the late Edward Noyce for his contribution to competitive dancing. This event is sponsored by his wife, Vera Randall-Noyce, and also our regular sponsors <a href="http://www.sparkledesignsuk.com" target="_blank">Sparkle Designs</a> without whom it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to run these events throughout the year.
    </p>
    <p>
        At this event there was a special raffle for the Heros charity for returning military personnel from Afganistan. On this occasion the Cairncross family matched the proceeds from ticket sales to go to the Charity.

        <h3>Junior Section</h3>
        <h4>Latin American</h4>
        <h5>Cha Cha & Rumba, Samba & Jive, Open Junior 5 Dance</h5>
        <p>These competitions were all contested by the same two couples and were all won by:</p>
        <p><strong>1st Robson & Lauren Broad</strong>.  This young man needs more body tone, at present he tends to dance down.  In Cha  Cha Cha it looked a little like it was a race to see who could finish first.  It is not a race it is all about being a partnership.  You must agree what you are trying to say, through the dance, as a couple.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Bradley Bird & Chloe Blackshaw</strong>.  A nice rhythmical couple with slick use of feet and legs in the more static figures.  The man needs more body tone and the lady needs more strength of leg and feet although this will come with age being as she is on the up side of the slope.  Nicely together as a couple.</p>

        <h4>Ballroom</h4>
        <h5>Junior 2 Dance Tango & Quickstep/Waltz & Foxtrot and 5 Dance</h5>
        <p>These were all single entry events and the winners were, <strong>Robson & Lauren Broad</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            These were three interesting competitions.  In the 2 dance events this young couple seemed to have a height differential problem causing the man to over present his arms.  This caused him to lose body tone and not carry his hips through.  In the rest break they had before the 5 dance event it was obvious that there was no difference in height.  After a short discussion with one of the non judging professionals in the audience they were able to come out in the 5 dance and present a very much improved setup.  It was lost in the Viennese Waltz I think because of lack of understanding of the dance and perhaps lack of practice.  Nice that we have young people who are still prepared to listen and then use that information in a practical way maybe there is still hope.  Having said all of that I still thought they were in too big a hurry in Foxtrot and needed more CBM.

        <h3>Adult</h3>
        <h4>Latin</h4>

        <h5>Beginners Cha Cha & Jive</h5>
        <p>This was a sole entry event and was won by <strong>Nigel De Zqgoa</strong> & <strong>Susie Gu</strong>.  A nice, well matched and rhythmical couple.  The man has a tendency to roll his shoulders up his back which distorts the line. (Sometimes I wonder what non - dancing people would make of these comments).   Arm usage is not good from either of them, they have not really understood that the arm movement starts from the body and rolls out through the joints of the arm.  </p>

        <h5>Novice Cha Cha & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Laurence Johnson–Shaw & Shaunna Cornnel</strong>.  This young couple in my opinion generate an exaggerated disparity of height.  This would be reduced if not eradicated by the man producing more body tone and dancing up to the lady. The young lady has obviously had a substantial amount of Ballet training and although I believe that the principles of dance are largely the same the actual poise and body shaping are not. If you want to dance Ballroom and Latin then you must find a way to incorporate the differences into you Ballet training just as you would if you wanted to take up Contemporary as opposed to Classical Ballet.  Lots of potential but requiring lots of work.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Nigel De Zqgoa & Susie Gu</strong>.  See above</p>

        <h5>Intermediate Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Frazer Magee & Elli Clark</strong>.  A well matched couple but hands and arms untidy and not matching.  Danced good locks in Cha Cha But the lady sometimes looked unhappy when dancing on her own.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Laurence Johnson–Shaw & Shaunna Cornnel</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Open Rumba</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Edward Gregson – Williams & Louise Willsher</strong>.  A well matched couple, well rehearsed but unfortunately there were lapses in the lady’s poise which resulted in her losing her hip action.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Richard Burke & Jean Wilkinson</strong>.  A very confident couple who danced well but just did not have the look of the winners.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Frazer Magee & Elli Clark</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Christopher & Diana Crowhurst</strong>.  The man needs more body tone, because you are taller than your partner is no excuse for not dancing up.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Stephen Layland & Anita Stone</strong>.  A nice couple but the man needs to use his feet and legs more to produce a better and smoother hip action.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Robert & Cindy Guerney</strong>.  Nice smooth dancers, although I personally prefer their ballroom.  The Latin still has a tight look to it, which restricts performance.</p>
        <p><strong>7th Dominque Corolleur & Diane Cottee</strong>.  The lady’s placement of feet has improved but she needs to use the inside edge of the foot more, this is where the power is.  More tone in her body may put the head back in line.  One gets the impression that the man wants to dance both sides of the partnership, you must lead the lady not drag her about off balance even in the Paso.  A good rule of thumb is, ask the lady to do what you want (lead) if she can’t or won’t then you ask the big question WHY?????.</p>

        <h5>Open Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Edward Gregson – Williams & Louise Willsher</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Frazer Magee & Elli Clark</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Robert & Cindy Guerney</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>4th Dominque Corolleur & Diane Cottee</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>5th Laurence Johnson – Shaw & Shaunna Cornnel</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>6th Nigel De Zqgoa & Susie Gu</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>7th John Attkinson & Louise Thornton</strong>.  Although I know this couple from dancing Ballroom I think this may be the first time I have seen them compete in Latin.  This was not their finest hour.  Trouble getting started, lack of commitment and projection from the man and forgotten routines earned them their placing.</p>

        <h5>Open Pre Champ Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba Paso & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Edward Gregson – Williams & Louise Willsher</strong>.   See above</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Frazer Magee & Elli Clark</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Antonello Scolaro & Daniela Dinolfo</strong>.   Small well matched couple but too contained, need to project more to make contact with the audience and the judges.</p>

        <h5>Senior Pre Champ Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Antonello Scolaro & Daniela Dinolfo</strong>.   See above</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Stephen Layland & Anita Stone</strong>.  See above</p>

        <h5>Senior 2 Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba Paso & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Richard Burke & Jean Wilkinson</strong>.   See above</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Christopher & Diana Crowhurst</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Dominque Corolleur & Diane Cottee</strong>.   See above</p>

        <h5>Open Senior Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba, Paso & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Ian Sharpe & Victoria Lawrence</strong>.  What can I say about this couple that I haven’t said before??  I like their approach to dancing, always looking for something different, a lady making a strong line with the man trailing off her body to extend the line across the floor looks good on occasion.  However when the man’s head is at or below her shoulder level consistently it begins to look weak and subservient, which is not what Latin dancing is about.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Richard Burke & Jean Wilkinson</strong>.   See above</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Dominique Corolleur & Diane Cottee</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>4th Christopher & Diana Crowhurst</strong>.   See above</p>
        <p><strong>5th Robert & Cindy Guerney</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>6th Antonello Scolaro & Daniela Dinolfo</strong>.   See above</p>
        <p><strong>7th Dominque Corolleur & Diane Cottee</strong>.  See above</p>

        <h5>Open Amateur Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba, Paso & Jive</h5>
        This was a solo entry competition won by, <strong>Edward Gregson-Williams</strong> & <strong>Louise Willsher</strong>.  See above.

        <h3>Adult</h3>
        <h4>Ballroom</h4>

        <h5>Novice Waltz, & Quickstep</h5>
        <p>
            This again was a single entry event won by, <strong>Laurence Johnson–Shaw</strong> & <strong>Shaunna Cornnel</strong>.  This young couple, are improving as ballroom dancers but please see the comments re. Latin as I believe the comments apply equally to both styles.  
        </p>

        <h5>Open Pre – Championship Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p>
            Another single entry competition this time won by, <strong>Frazer Magee</strong> & <strong>Elli Clark</strong>.  For me this young lady is positioned too far in front of partner, which restricts the swing, disturbs the contact and therefore the lead.
        </p>

        <h5>Senior Intermediate Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep.</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  James Barnes & Georgina Falconer</strong>.   A soft and easy pairing but poor posture ruins the look with the man having his head weight ahead of his body.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Joe Smith & Veronica Jevons</strong>.  Poor posture restricts the movement and swing.</p>

        <h5>Senior Pre/Champ. Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st David & Jane Corby</strong>.   An improving couple but they lose the common centre, which results in a broken shoulder line.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Stephen Layland & Anita Stone</strong>.  This couple produced a poise and tone, that made them look solid and inhibited the use of lowering and CBM that in turn restricted the movement.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd James Barnes & Georgina Falconer</strong>.   See above</p>
        <p><strong>4th  Steve Ewing & Roz Barber</strong>.  A very experienced couple, who dance nicely, but need more movement to progress.  The ladies head is becoming over active, perhaps as a reaction to wanting to do more but not getting the opportunity.</p>
        <p><strong>5th  Frank & Angela Byrne</strong>.   Using the upper body weight to move into promenade means that the foot is behind the weight, therefore you cannot use the leg and foot to propel the body.  This leaves you out of control and inevitably out of time.</p>

        <h5>Intermediate 4 Dance</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Frazer Magee & Elli Clark</strong>.   A well matched young couple who, for me, have postural problems which inhibit the swing.  I feel that they are too much in front of each other so CBM and a smooth action are difficult.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Laurence Johnson-Shaw & Shaunna Falconer</strong>.  The man needs better body tone and poise to improve the connection and as a result the lead.  Please see the Latin comments above as I think the comments apply to both styles.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd James Barnes & Georgina Falconer</strong>.   See above</p>

        <h5>Over 50’s Pre/Champ Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Jeff & Tracy Fryer</strong>.   A nice well matched couple who brought their own cheering group, but for me the arms and shoulders were over presented resulting in a poor shoulder line.  </p>
        <p><strong>2nd Steve Ewing & Roz Barber</strong>.  See Above</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Frank & Angela Byrne</strong>.   See Above</p>

        <h5>Over 35’s Waltz</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Chris Vowden & Gail Butt</strong>.   In my opinion the man needs to improve his poise and dance up to his lady, at present he tends to have his upper body weight behind his feet.  The lady I think is too far in front of the man making the production of the swing more difficult.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Robert & Cindy Gurney</strong>.  A much improved couple with a good smooth action.  Now however I would like to see more and stronger body lines.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd  Bob & Jenny Samson</strong>.   An experienced couple but today I felt their alignment and poise were poor and they seemed under rehearsed.</p>
        <p><strong>4th  Christopher & Diana Crowhurst</strong>.  Today I thought there was a loss of centre, which produced a poor lead and as a result the lady was at sixes and sevens.  In my opinion they are going to have to find a way to reduce the affect of the difference in height on their performance.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Stephen Layland & Anita Stone</strong>.   See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th  David & Jane Corby</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Senior 3 Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st David & Maggie Durrant</strong>.   Nice soft easy movers, but sometimes, like today the softening in the arms and shoulders means the elbows are too low which ruins the picture but today they were the winners. </p>
        <p><strong>2nd Bob & Jenny Samson.  </strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Trevor & Alison Laflin</strong>.   This couple need more flight and swing with CBM especially in the Foxtrot.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Frank & Angela Byrne</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Joe Smith & Veronica Jevons</strong>.   See above.</p>

        <h5>Over 35’s Foxtrot</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Chris Vowden & Gail Butt</strong>.   See above</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Robert & Cindy Gurney</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>3rd David & Maggie Durrant. </strong>.   See above</p>

        <p><strong>2nd John Atkinson & Louise Thornton.  </strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Robert & Cindy Gurney</strong>.   See above (An unbreakable tie for third place)</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Chris Vowden & Gail Butt</strong>.  See above (An unbreakable tie for third place)</p>
        <p><strong>5th David & Jane Corby.  </strong>.   See above</p>

        <h5>Open Senior.  Waltz, Tango, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Ian Sharp & Victoria Lawrence</strong>.   For me, this couple, need to agree upon what they want their dancing to portray.  At the moment the lady seems to want to produce all body lines in an upward direction while the man wants them to be down and spread over the floor.  Either one is possible, and acceptable, even in the same dance, but you must agree upon which option for each line not try to do both in the same line. </p>
