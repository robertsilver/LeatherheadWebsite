    <h1>Cairncross/Follett Awards Day - 13th March 2016. (Through one man’s eyes.  Harry Ferris.)</h1>
    <p>
        The day started a little shakily.  Our marathon runner Sheila was ill and couldn’t attend
        so Ron was on hospital duties at home and so we had no photographer.  The adjudicator
        from Australia (Stephen Thomas) was unable to attend.  However emergency systems
        came into action and fortunately, on extremely short notice, Mr Michael Pharaoh
        stepped in as a replacement adjudicator (many thanks Michael), Julie Follett’s daughter
        Chantal took on the challenge of the marathon and did extremely well, yours truly
        stepped in as photographer and the lovely Linda Venables keep us all supplied with
        liquid refreshment throughout the day.  The Dunkirk spirit still flourishes.
    </p>
    <p>
        At this event there was a special raffle for the Heros charity for returning military personnel from Afganistan. On this occasion the Cairncross family matched the proceeds from ticket sales to go to the Charity.

    </p>
    <p>Unfortunately the Juvenile and Junior competitors were conspicuous by their absence, however this did not detract from the atmosphere in the hall and it was a very enjoyable day.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <section>
        <p>There were no Juvenile competitors and therefore the Juvenile programme was abandoned.</p>
        <h3>Junior Section</h3>
        <h4>Latin American</h4>
        <h5>Cha Cha & Jive and Rumba & Jive</h5>
        <p>These were all single entry events and were all won by:-  <strong>Andre Sincik and Liberty Mann</strong>.  An attractive couple but in a very trying situation, it is not easy to go onto the floor as a Beginner on your own.  Well done.  The environment is nerve wracking and unfortunately this highlights your shortcomings.</p>

        <h4>Ballroom</h4>
        <h5>Junior Beginners Quickstep & Novice Waltz & Quickstep</h5>
        <p>These were again single entry events and were therefore won by :-  <strong>Andre Sincik & Liberty Mann</strong>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Adult</h3>
        <h4>Latin</h4>

        <h5>Over 35’s Beginners Cha Cha & Jive</h5>
        <p>This was a sole entry event and was won by <strong>Nigel De Zqgoa</strong> & <strong>Susie Gu</strong>.  A nice, well matched and rhythmical couple.  The man has a tendency to roll his shoulders up his back which distorts the line. (Sometimes I wonder what non - dancing people would make of these comments).   Arm usage is not good from either of them, they have not really understood that the arm movement starts from the body and rolls out through the joints of the arm.  </p>

        <h5>Novice Cha Cha & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Barry & Carol Gravenell</strong>.  A nice easy moving couple who need to work on their poise as a priority.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Colin and Melanie Salmon</strong>.  The man seems to have a very laidback approach which at this grade is not a problem but may become one later.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd  Halit Derbent & Amy Wong</strong>.  A well matched couple where poise and body tone are the main detractors.</p>

        <h5>Novice Cha, Cha & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Charlie Warriner & Mollie Clarke</strong>.  Nice young couple who seem to be making progress in the right direction.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Ian Pritchard & Emma Goold</strong>.   A nice very well turned out couple who, for some reason, I feel came from the University scene and are testing the water on open circuit.  If that is so, and not just me imagining things, welcome.  For me the main problem is timing issues, listen to more dance music and count the beats and bars to become more familiar with the amount of time you have available.</p>

        <h5>Over 35’s Novice  Cha Cha & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Robin & Anne Farquhar</strong>.  For me you need to work on poise and body tone.  At present you both seem to dance down.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Erich Ludwig & Bebbey Newman</strong>.  An improving couple keep working.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd  Barry & Carol Gravenell</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th  Colin & Melanie Salmon</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Intermediate 4 Dance</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Laurence Johnson - Shaw & Josie Neame</strong>.  For me the man needs to dance up more to control the body shapes.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Kiersty & Charline Hoad</strong>.  Very well rehearsed young ladies but seemed to tire as the day went on.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd  Ian Pritchard & Emma Goold</strong>.  See above</p>

        <h5>Over 35 Intermediate CCC, Samba, Rumba & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Robin & Anne Farquhar</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Erich Ludwig & Bebbey Newman</strong>. See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd  Barry & Carol Gravenell</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th  Colin & Melanie Salmon</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Prechamp 4 Dance Latin</h5>
        <p>This was a single entry event and was won by :-  Laurence Johnson - Shaw & Josie Neame.   See above.</p>

        <h5>Over 35 Prechamp 4 Dance Latin</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  David Sloper & Karen Lintern</strong>.   I feel that your mantra for the immediate future should be body tone.  Yes your feet should be using the floor but not at the expense of the body.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Petar Mincheu & Anita Stone</strong>.  Here again the man needs to dance up.  At present the head is in front of the spine and the shoulders are rounded.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd  Garry Allen & Jackie Montgomery</strong>.  Now I am going to be horrible.  Garry the best head position you showed me today was in the line up for the prize presentation.  Didn’t need it there, needed it in the dance please.</p>
        <p><strong>4th  Graham & Helen Diles</strong>.  Not your best days Latin it is normally better than that.  Lost the plot a couple of times, not sure who does what next.  Seemed nervy to-day.</p>
        <p><strong>5th  Robin & Anne Farquhar</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th  Erich Ludwig & Bebbey Newman</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>7th  Martin Arthur & Debbie Ford</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Senior 2 Latin 5 Dance</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Colin & Sandra Adam</strong>.   Convincing winners to-day but I personally would like to see more body tone from the man to connect the arms to the foot and leg actions particularly in Paso where the arms seem to move for no reason.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Stephen & Marilyn Cooper:</strong>.  A very experienced couple who I feel have lost their way a little of late.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd  Lee & Sasha Covington</strong>.  I felt the lady had balance issues to-day I think as a result of using the length of her feet which gives her too narrow a foot base.</p>
        <p><strong>4th  Christopher & Diana Crowhurst</strong>.  For me the man needs to improve his body tone and accept the advantages the disparity in height gives him in Latin.</p>
        <p><strong>5th  Stewart Woskett & Louise Hollamby</strong>.  This couple have retained their recent improvement in overall performance.</p>
        <p><strong>6th  Michael & Katie Brown</strong>.  A nice couple but to make progress the man will have to improve his body tone.  At the moment his front looks like it has collapsed.</p>

        <h5>Senior 1 Latin 5 Dance</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Ian Sharpe & Victoria Lawrence</strong>.  Worthy winners to-day an improved performance since the last time I saw them.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Robin & Marianne Sudell</strong>.  A very experienced couple but I feel there is a stiffness in the man’s action which is what made the difference to-day.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd  Stephen & Marilyn Cooper</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th  Christopher & Diana Crowhurst</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th  Lee & Sasha Covington</strong>.  See above.</p>
        
        <h5>Open Amateur 5 Dance Latin</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Oskar Odiakosa & Nikita Vince</strong>. A very enthusiastic and athletic man in danger of overpowering his partner.  However, a convincing winner to-day.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Jonathan Salmon & Amy Hankin</strong>.  A nice young couple progressing in the right direction.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd  Robin & Marianne Sudell</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Open Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Oskar Odiakosa & Nikita Vince</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Jonathan Salmon & Amy Hankin</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd  Robin & Marianne Sudell</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th  Laurence Johnson-Shaw & Josie Neame</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <p><strong>2nd  Jonathan Salmon & Amy Hankin</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd  Robin & Marianne Sudell</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th  Ist van Adorjan & Virginia Feher</strong>. A well matched couple and a very attractive lady.  Man needs to be seen to be a little bit more in charge.</p>
        <p><strong>5th  David Sloper & Karen Lintern</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th  Lee & Sasha Covington</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>7th Stewart Woskett & Louise Hollamby</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Under 21 Latin 5 dance</h5>
        <p>This was a single entry event and was won by <strong>Jonathan Salmon & Amy Hankin</strong>.  See above.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Adult</h3>
        <h4>Ballroom</h4>

        <h5>Beginners Waltz & Quickstep</h5>
        <p>
            This was a single entry event and was won by <strong>Charles Warriner & Mollie Clark</strong>. A very well presented couple but they have have serious timing problems.
        </p>

        <h5>Over 35 Beginners Waltz & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st  Colin & Melanie Salmon</strong>.  1st  Colin & Melanie Salmon:-  See comments in Latin section above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Barry & Carol Gravenell</strong>.  2nd  Barry & Carol Gravenell:-  Nice couple but need to work on their poise and body tone.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd  Halit Derbent & Amy Wong</strong>.  3rd  Halit Derbent & Amy Wong:-  A small couple who need to work on their top line.</p>

        <h5>Over 50’s Prechamp  4 Dance Ballroom</h5>
        <p><strong>1st   Gary Allen & Jackie Montgomery</strong>. See comments in the Latin section above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd  Martin Arthur & Debbie Ford</strong>.  A very good looking couple, for me the man needs more body tone and the lady needs to dance up more to progress.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd  Erich Ludwig & Debbey Newman</strong>.  A tendency to dance the man’s left side too open spoils the top line.</p>
        <p><strong>4th  Elwyn Gunter & Kath Shrives</strong>.  A nice couple well matched but for me the man carries his shoulders too high which distorts the top.</p>
