    <h2>Cairncross and Follett Awards Day - 23rd March 2014 (Through one man’s eyes.  Harry Ferris.)</h2>
    <p>
        To-day’s event at Leatherhead was the <strong>Cairncross and Follett Awards Day</strong> with a special new event to find The Most Dedicated Ballroom Gentleman.  This delicate assessment was left in the hands of four ladies of our acquaintance namely :- Georgina Cairncross, Julie Cairncross, Jeannie Ferris and Julie Follett these stalwarts selected a final six who then danced a quickstep and all of the ladies in the room voted for the winner who on the day was that well known smarmer John Atkinson.  All of this, was made possible, by the Follett Family.  Steve and Julie provided and presented the trophy for the event together with their daughter Chantal a former dancing star.  Their other daughter Tina, also a former dancer, was unfortunately unable to attend to make it a total family affair.

    <h3>Results</h3>

    <section>
        <h3>Juvenile</h3>
        <h4>Latin American</h4>
        <p>These were, unfortunately, all single entry events.</p>
        <p class="no-gap"><strong>Makar Sitnikuv & Grace Ward</strong>.  I believe this was their first competition and they make a very talented couple.  Here we have Grace by name and grace by nature a young lady who projects well and draws the audience into their dance while showing that she is enjoying what she is doing, very strongly supported by her partner Makar a young man of talent from Russia.  Both technically strong and work well together although for me I would like to see Makar improve his core strength as he is inclined to collapse the centre and lean forward.</p>
        <h4 class="margin-top-10">Ballroom (Tango & Quickstep, Waltz & Tango and Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep)</h4>
        <p>These again were all single entry competitions.</p>
        <p><strong>Makar Sitnikuv & Grace Ward</strong>.  Here this couple proved that they are not a one trick pony by producing excellent performances in the Ballroom section.  In this discipline I thought the man’s left elbow was too high although the lady was able to retain her position and a little more CBM would have helped.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Junior Section</h3>
        <h4>Latin American (Cha Cha & Jive, Jive and Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba, Paso & Jive)</h4>
        <p>These again were all single entry competitions.  Where are all the young dancers?</p>
        <p><strong>Hughie Cook & Ellise Milan Vega</strong>. A talented couple showing a lot of promise but for me the young man is not grounded and seems to float over the floor which precludes good use of body shaping.</p>
        <h4 class="margin-top-10">Ballroom (Waltz & Quickstep, Open Junior Tango & Quickstep and Open Junior Waltz & Foxtrot)</h4>
        <p>These again were all single entry competitions.</p>
        <p><strong>Hughie Cook & Ellise Milan Vega</strong>.  I thought the setup was poor resulting in poor contact.  This lead to some confusion within the partnership and on a busier floor might be a bigger problem.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Adult</h3>
        <h4>Latin</h4>

        <h5>Beginners Cha Cha Cha & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Richard Reeves & Abigale Buckland</strong>.  A smallish couple who presented well and left the impression that they will not be eligible to dance beginner for much longer.  A well controlled performance.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Aitor Quintana & Magdalena Helner</strong>.  This couple are moving much more than the last time I saw them which gives them a look of freedom.  They are more of a team dancing for each other.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Raymond Ruiz & Anne Taylor</strong>.  I don’t think I have seen this pair before but they danced a good competition although the man gets a little enthusiastic on occasion, not a bad complaint.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Adrian Wisner & Terrasa Dawson</strong>.  Another pairing I don’t know.  A tall man, with long arms, which are such an asset, when used well as they were today..</p>
        <p><strong>5th Erick Ludwig & Debbey Newman</strong>.  This couple, need to think about their poise and posture.  The lady needs more tone throughout and the man has a habit of dropping his left shoulder back and down.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Simon Croydon-fowler & Jo Hutchinson</strong>.  A striking couple but lack body tone, which coupled with poor use of feet and legs kills the hip action and leaves the bodies looking fixed.</p>
        <p>A good competition fairly closely contested throughout.  Well done beginners.</p>

        <h5>Novice Cha Cha & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Richard Reeves & Abigail Buckland</strong>.  This result certainly brings them closer to moving out of beginners.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Rowan Birch & Olivia Row</strong>.  Another new to me couple, well matched although I feel the man needs to improve his posture to look more dominant.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Laurence Johmson-Shaw & Shaunna Cornell</strong>.  A nice couple with a height problem especially when dancing underarm figures where the man’s top line gets distorted reaching up and the lady struggles to make life easy for him.  Reassess the choreography perhaps.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Max Whetton & Natasha Wale</strong>.  A nice young couple but for some reason the lady seems to want to dance down all of the time I would suggest a higher eye line and more projection out to the audience.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Jeff Moore & Katie Page</strong>.  A tall, well matched, couple who I do not remember having seen before and I think are probably at the beginning of their dancing career.  A very elegant couple heading in the right direction.</p>

        <h5>Intermediate Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Elli Clarke & Chloe Stevens</strong>.  A very good all girls couple beautifully turned out and rehearsed a credit to their trainers and support group.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Rowan Birch & Olivia Row</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Laurence Johnson – Shaw & Shaunna Cornell</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Yi Ping & Hong Song</strong>.  A very nice couple, who are improving steadily.  You need to make eye contact with your partner through the dance but part of the time you have to open the partnership up and let the audience into your world.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Daniel Lear & Kirsty Hoad</strong>.  Daniel why do you do this to me?  The band sets the tempo and the rhythm and no matter what you do as a dancer you can’t change that so why try.  The man who made time made lots so use some.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Max Whetton & Natasha Wale</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Open Pre Champ Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba Paso & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Elli Clarke & Chloe Stevens</strong>.   See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Daniel Lear & Kirsty Hoad</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Senior Pre Champ Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Yiping & Hong Songo</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Robert Silver & Linda Lim</strong>.  An attractive couple who I don’t remember seeing dance Latin before.  In my opinion the man’s body was locked in position which restricted the body action and incorrect use of feet and legs failed to produce a hip action.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Adrian Wisner & Terresa Dawson</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Senior 2 Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba Paso & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Ian & Jennifer Curson</strong>.  A very experienced couple and it showed today.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Raju & Lorraine Arulananthan</strong>.  A nice couple who danced well but I felt that the man needed more toning through his body to balance his lady.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Paul & Nina Dodds</strong>.  Not the best dancing I have seen from this couple a little lackadaisical for me today.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Chris & Jenny Wherry</strong>.  An improving couple but a poor use of feet let them down.</p>

        <h5>Open Senior Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba, Paso & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Ian Sharpe & Victoria Lawrence</strong>.  Because of the height discrepancy which only shows when they dance one gets the impression that the man is out/over dancing the lady which spoils the look of the performance.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Raju & Lorraine Arulananthan</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Ian & Jennifer Curson</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Paul & Nina Dodds</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Open Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Richard Reeves</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Elli Clarke & Chloe Stevens</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Rowan Birch & Olivia Row</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Laurence Johnson–Shaw & Shaunna Cornell</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Max Whetton & Natasha Wale</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Yi Ping & Hong Song</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Open Rumba</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Ian & Jennifer Curson</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Rowan Birch & Olivia Row</strong>s.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Elli Clarke & Chloe Stevens</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Yi Ping & Hong Song</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Laurence Johnson – Shaw & Shaunna Cornell</strong>. See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Daniel Lear & Kirsty Hoad.  </strong>.  See above.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Adult</h3>
        <h4>Ballroom</h4>

        <h5>Beginners Waltz & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Max Whetton & Natasha Wale</strong>.  Nice young couple with a slight height difference.  Very little body contact and lost the common centre with the lady dancing down.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Jeff Moore & Katie Page</strong>.  An elegant lady who projects well.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Richard Reeves</strong>.  A small couple, who are neat and tidy, but need more lowering to produce movement.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Erick Ludwig & Debbey Newman</strong>.  Poor arm and shoulder line as a result of the man dropping his left shoulder back and breaking his left side.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Raymond Ruiz & Anne Taylor</strong>.  Well matched couple but need to lower more to produce swing.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Martin Muriuk & Romona Cengher</strong>.  Elegant lady but man needs to improve his body tone and use of feet to progress.</p>

        <h5>Novice Waltz & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Rowan Birch & Olivia Row</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Max Whetton & Natasha Wale</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Richard Reeves</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Laurence Johnson-Shaw & Shaunna Cornell</strong>.  A couple with a height discrepancy, the lady being the taller.  At the moment she is distorting her body in an attempt to match the man.  It is not working, you need to find another approach.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Jeff Moore & Katie Page</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Raymond Ruiz & Anne Taylor</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Intermediate 4 Dance</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Rowan Birch & Olivia Row</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Max Whetton & Natasha Wale</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Elli Clarke & Chloe Stevens</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Laurence Johnson–Shaw & Shaunna Cornell</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Daniel Lear & Kirsty Hoad</strong>.  As in the Latin there are timing issues throughout the dances.</p>
        <p><strong>6th James Barnes & Georgina Falconer</strong>.  A soft free moving couple but the man’s head is forward on to partner, which closes down the top line.</p>

        <h5>Open Pre/Championship 5 Dance</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Elli Clarke & Chloe Stevens</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Daniel Lear & Kirsty Hoad</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Over 50’s Pre/Champ Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st David Pullinger & Sue Nixon</strong>.  A smooth easy couple, to my mind to easy I feel they need more attack and power than they are currently showing.  At present the man’s arms are too far back which upsets the balance.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Bruce & Susan Stephen</strong>.  The posture and movement had improved in the early part of the day but it tailed off as the day progressed.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Lawrence & Linda Jones</strong>.  This couple, need to improve their posture, the man’s head is often in the wrong position which causes him to leave his rear end behind and upsets the balance of the couple.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Chris & Jenny Wherry</strong>.  The footwork of this couple is often suspect, which means the body is not where it should be in movement.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Ken Wright & Sue Telford</strong>.  This I believe is a new partnership, which has not yet got together.  Poor shape and lack of body tone results in loss of contact and the common centre.</p>

        <h5>Senior 2.  Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Paul & Nina Dodds</strong>.  This couple, are showing a steady improvement in their ballroom performances.  However I still think the left side is too open which gives them problems in overall shape.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Bob & Jenny Sampson</strong>.  In my opinion this couple have poor body contact and the lady takes the right side off which produces a poorly shaped left arm.  As a result to get out from promenade positions the man throws his upper body weight out first causing him to produce a short step not exclusively but more obviously in Foxtrot.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd John & Sue Kerr</strong>.  An improving couple but John suffers from tall man syndrome he feels he doesn’t need to present a toned body and extended head.  Not true, has to be done.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Patrick & Dorothy Lewis.  </strong>.  A nice easy moving couple but the man must work on the core muscles to produce a toned front for lady to dance with, it would also let him make maximum height to give a stronger more dominant look to the pair.  If the lady is to produce her best show she must have something to work off.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Mark Raybould & Maria Boxley</strong>.  Mark I notice you loose the glasses for Latin presumably for fear of them falling off, if you could do the same for ballroom it would help.  I know from experience that you will move your head to get rid of the reflections on the glass but not always into the best position for dancing.  At present I think the lady’s weight is too far back behind her feet, which is unbalancing the partnership.</p>
        <p><strong>6th David Pullinger & Sue Nixon</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>7th Chris & Jackie Floyd</strong>.  A well matched couple, but poor use of feet produces a poor body connection.</p>

        <h5>Senior Intermediate Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st James Barnes & Georgina Falconer</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd r Quintana & Magdalena Helner</strong>.  An improving couple but to my mind the lady is producing her poise from too low down and restricting the man’s movement.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Raymond Ruiz & Anne Taylor</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Erick Ludwig & Debbey Newman</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Senior Pre/Champ. Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Yi Ping & Hong Song</strong>.  Much improved but now need more lowering to increase travel.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd David Pullinger & Sue Nixon</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Mark Raybould & Maria Boxley</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Lawrence & Linda Jones</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th James Barnes & Georgina Falconer</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Aitor Quintana & Magdalena Helner</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>7th Ken Wright & Sue Telford</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Over 35’s Tango</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Paul & Nina Dodds</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Yi Ping & Hong Song</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Mark Raybould & Maria Boxley</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th David Pullinger & Sue Nixon</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Chris & Jackie Floyd</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Over 35’s Waltz</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Paul & Nina Dodds</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Yi Ping & Hong Song</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd John & Sue Kerr</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Bob & Jenny Sampson</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th David Pullinger & Sue Nixon</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Simon Croydon-fowler & Jo Hutchinson</strong>.  Not a comfortable day today too many structural and setup problems.  All fixable, but needing work.</p>
        <p><strong>7th Mark Raybould & Maria Boxley</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Over 35’s Foxtrot</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Paul & Nina Dodds</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Yi Ping & Hong Song</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd John & Sue Kerr</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Bob & Jenny Sampson</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Mark Raybould & Maria Boxley</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Chris & Jackie Floyd</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Open Senior.  Waltz, Tango, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Ian Sharpe & Virginia Lawrence</strong>.  Although this couple, were emphatic winners of this event, once again we had this mismatch across the partnership.  While I totally agree that you should be dancing to the maximum I believe it should be the maximum of the couple and not of the individual. </p>
        <p><strong>2nd Paul & Nina Dodds</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Yi Ping & Hong Song</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th John & Sue Kerr</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Patrick & Dorothy Lewis</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Aitor Quintana & Magdalena Helner</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Senior 3 Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Bob & Jenny Sampson</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Patrick & Dorothy Lewis</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Simon Croydon-fowler & Jo Hutchinson</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Chris & Jackie Floyd</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Bruce & Susan Stephen</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Chris & Jenny Wherry</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Open Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st John Atkinson & Louise Thornton</strong>.  Very convincing winners of the event.  I personally would like to see improved posture and tone from John, which would allow Louise to expand her dance.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Paul & Nina Dodds</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Yi Ping & Hong Song</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th John & Sue Kerr</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Elli Clarke & Chloe Stevens</strong>.  A very good all girl couple who danced well with good contact and shaping throughout.</p>

        <h5>Open Viennese Waltz</h5>
        <p><strong>1st John Atkinson & Louise Thornton</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Paul & Nina Dodds</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Yi Ping & Hong Song</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>4th David Pullinger & Sue Nixon</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>5th Elli Clarke & Chloe Stevens</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>6th Max Whetton & Natasha Wale</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Open Amateur Waltz, Tango, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p>This unfortunately was a single entry competition so we finished with a mini demonstration by the winners</p>
        <p><strong>1st John Atkinson & Louise Thornton</strong>.  A very nice effort as was expected since they had danced well all day.</p>
