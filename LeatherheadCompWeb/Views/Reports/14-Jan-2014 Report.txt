    <h2>Bill and Silvia Mitchell Tribute Day - 14th January 2014 (Through one man’s eyes.  Harry Ferris.)</h2>
    <p>
        Today’s event at Leatherhead was the Bill and Silvia Mitchell Tribute Day sponsored by <a href="http://www.sparkledesignsuk.com" target="_blank">Sparkle Designs</a> and without their support these competition days could not continue.  Jeannie Ferris presented the prizes, an apt choice, as she knew Bill & Silvia for many years both as promotors at The Rivoli Ballroom and as adjudicators around the circuit.

        <strong>Sponsors:</strong> <a href="http://www.sparkledesignsuk.com" target="_blank">Sparkle Designs</a> represented to-day by both Michael and Beverly supported by two lovely young ladies who were too shy to give me their names.

        <h3>Juvenile</h3>
        <h4>Latin American</h4>
        <p>The Juvenile Novice Cha Cha & Jive and the Juvenile all girls Cha Cha, Rumba & Jive were single entry events and were won by Tilly Moffet & Bonnie Papper two visitors from the Isle of Man.</p>
        <p>The Cha Cha & Samba, the Rumba and Jive, and the Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba & Jive competitions were all contested by the same two couples and the adjudicators were consistent in their results.</p>
        <p class="no-gap"><strong>1st  Tim Woodford & Julia Wojcik</strong>.  This couple had a much more competitive style than their opponents.</p>
        <p class="no-gap"><strong>2  Tilly Moffet & Bonnie Papper</strong>.  Two young ladies progressing in the right direction, well rehearsed with a nice use of arms.</p>
        <h4 class="margin-top-10">Ballroom</h4>
        <p>The <strong>Juvenile Waltz & Quickstep and the all girls Waltz, Tango & Quickstep</strong> were again single entry competitions won by <strong>Tilly Moffet & Bonnie Papper</strong>.</p>
        <p>The open <strong>Juvenile Tango & Quickstep and the Open Juvenile Waltz & Tango</strong> were all contested by the same two couples and the adjudicators were again consistent in their results.</p>
        <p><strong>1st Tim Woodford & Julia Wojcik</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Tilly Moffet & Bonnie Papper</strong>.   See above.</p>
        <p>The Juvenile Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep.  Once again a single entry competition which was won by Tim Woodford & Julia Wojcik.</p>

        <h3>Junior Section</h3>
        <h4>Latin American</h4>
        <p>The All Girls Cha Cha, Rumba and Jive was again a single entry competition and was won by Rebecca and Rachel Middleton.</p>
        <h5>Open Junior Cha Cha & Rumba</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Robson Broad & Lauren Claydon</strong>. A nice young couple who need to look at their poise and shoulder presentation.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Bradley Tailor & Katie Pring</strong>.  A little height mismatch not a major problem in Latin.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Rebecca & Rachel Middleton</strong>.  A nice all girl pairing well rehearsed and matched arm lines, foot and leg action the major weakness I thought.</p>
        <p>The same three couples contested the Samba & Jive competition with the following result.</p>
        <p><strong>1st Bradley Tailor & Katie Pring</strong>.	See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Robson Broad & Lauren Claydon</strong>.	See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Rebecca & Rachel Middleton</strong>.	See above.</p>
        <p>This result was repeated in the Five Dance Competition.</p>
        <h4 class="margin-top-10">Ballroom</h4>
        <h5>The Junior All Girls (Waltz, Tango, Quickstep)</h5>
        <p>This was a single entry competition and was won by <strong>Rebecca & Rachel Middleton</strong>.</p>
        <h5>Open Junior Tango & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Robson Broad & Lauren Claydon</strong>.  A couple with top line problems.  Robson don’t think of lifting your arms.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Rebecca & Rachel Middleton</strong>.  Poor use of feet not helped by the heel of the leader’s left shoe folding under her foot.  Old adage, “fail to prepare, prepare to fail”. </p>
        <p><strong>3rd Bradley Taylor & Katie Pring</strong>.  Here we have a height differential problem.  The difference in height is not the problem, it is how you deal with it which is the problem.  At the moment Bradley you are dealing with it by taking your body off your girl, not good.</p>

        <h5>Open Junior Waltz & Foxtrot</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Robson Broad & Lauren Claydon</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Rebecca & Rachel Middleton</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Bradley Taylor & Katie Prin</strong>g. See above.</p>

        The organiser is finding it difficult to understand why these Junior & Juvenile events are so poorly supported and would be thankful for any and all feedback from anyone.

    <section>
        <h3>Adult</h3>
        <h4>Latin</h4>

        <h5>Beginners Cha Cha Cha & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Robin & Anne Farquhar</strong>.  Still need to work on the poise and body tone to release the tension in the shoulders and arms.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Nigel De Silva & Susie Gu</strong>.  In an effort to get grounded the man loses his body tone which brings his shoulder forward outside the foot base which reduces his contact with the floor rather than increasing it.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Erich Ludwig & Debbie Newman</strong>.  Erich tends to carry his weight too far back which precludes good foot and leg usage. </p>

        <h5>Novice Cha Cha & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Nicolas & Alison Gallagher–Hughes</strong>.  A distinct lack of hip action which suggests incorrect use of feet and legs.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Erich Ludwig & Debbie Newman</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Robin & Anne Farquhar</strong>.  See Above.</p>

        <h5>Intermediate Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Michael O’Leary & Cheryl Davie</strong>s.   Here I see a lack of body tone and the man carries his weight to far forward which limits the hip action to a side to side movement.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Antonello Scolaro & Daniela DiNolfo</strong>.  A nice couple but lack of body toning spoils the look.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Yiping & Hong Son</strong>g.  A very nice looking couple but they need to produce a more positive look.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Nicholas & Alison Gallagher – Hughes</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th There was an unbreakable tie for this place between Robin & Anne Farquhar and Erich Ludwig & Debbey Newman</strong>.  For analysis of both couples see Above.</p>

        <h5>Open Pre Champ Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba Paso & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Michael O’Leary & Cheryl Davies</strong>.   See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Antonello Scolaro & Daniela DiNolfo</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Senior Pre Champ Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba & Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Antonello Scolaro & Daniela DiNolfo</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Stephen Layland & Anita Stone</strong>.  This man is very tense in the top line chest, shoulders and arms and as a consequence the partnership loses the look of question and answer.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Yiping & Hong Song</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Chris & Jenny Wherry</strong>.  In my opinion this couple had a very good day much more together and lyrical than I have seen them before.  Whatever you are doing keep doing it.</p>

        <h5>Senior 2 Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba Paso & Jive</h5>
        <p>This was a solo entry competition.</p>
        <p><strong>1st Chris & Jenny Wherry</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Open Senior Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba, Paso & Jive</h5>
        <p>This was a solo entry competition.</p>
        <p><strong>1st Ian Sharpe & Victoria Lawrence</strong>.  This couple try very hard to produce a performance of stature and dominance but for me there is a lack of sympathy between them which defeats the object. </p>

        <h5>Open Amateur Cha Cha Cha, Samba, Rumba, Paso & Jive.</h5>
        <p>This was a solo entry competition.</p>
        <p><strong>1st Alex Maryon & Stephanie Higgens</strong>.  A very nice couple, who not only love to dance but love to dance together.  It is so nice to see a team working together with a common goal.  </p>

        <h5>Open Jive</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Alex Maryon & Stephanie Higgens</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Michael O’Leary & Cheryl Davies</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Yiping & Hong Song</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Antonello Scolaro & Daniela DiNolfo</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Nigel De Silva & Susie Gu</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Erich Ludwig & Debbie Newman</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>7th Robin & Anne Farquha</strong>r.  See Above.</p>

        <h5>Open Rumba</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Alex Maryon & Stephanie Higgens</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Michael O’Leary & Cheryl Davie</strong>s.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Yiping & Hong Song</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Antonello Scolaro & Daniela DiNolfo</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Stephen Layland & Anita Stone</strong>. See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Erich Ludwig & Debbie Newman</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>7th Robin & Anne Farquhar</strong>.  See Above.</p>

        <h3>Adult</h3>
        <h4>Ballroom</h4>

        <h5>Beginners Waltz & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Erich Ludwig & Debbey Newman</strong>.  In my opinion the man takes his weight behind his feet which makes it difficult for him to get C.B.M. and kills the swing.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Robin & Anne Farquhar</strong>.  For me this couple need to dance up to each other more and the man needs to relax his top and take a higher eye line.</p>

        <h5>Novice Waltz & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Erich Ludwig & Debbey Newman</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Robin & Anne Farquhar</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Intermediate 5 Dance</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Michael O’Leary & Cheryl Davies</strong>.  A well matched couple but in my opinion the balances are not as good as they could be.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd James & Marie Ovenden</strong>.  A nice free moving couple but I feel the man has over presented arms, which distort the shoulder line and the lady needs more body tone to dance up to him.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Neil Gessey & Jo Willis</strong>.   I don’t think I have seen this couple before and my immediate reaction is that the lady needs to look at her poise and as a couple they lose body contact.</p>
        <p><strong>4th James Barnes & Georgina Falconer</strong>.  A nice soft easy moving couple, but the man leans forward putting weight on to partner and closing up the heads.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Robin & Ann Farquhar</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Senior Intermediate Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st James Barnes & Georgina Falconer</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Erich Ludwig & Debbey Newman</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Robin & Ann Farquhar</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Joe Smith & Veronica Jevons</strong>.  Movement from foot to foot not clean and as a result timing becomes an issue.</p>

        <h5>Open Pre/Championship 5 Dance</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Alex Maryon & Stephanie Higgins</strong>.  Danced very well to-day although I feel they need more lowering and use of the standing leg to expand the swing.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Robert Silver & Linda Lim</strong>.  Another couple who had a good day.  Robert has lost a lot of the over toning of the arms and shoulders but I think the elbows are still too far back.  This restricts Linda and pushes her out of position.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Michael O’Leary & Cheryl Davies</strong>.  See above. </p>
        <p><strong>4th Damian & Louise Devoy</strong>.  The overall look of this couple has improved but there are still a number of places where the man’s shoulder weight is outside the foot base and they are therefore off balance.</p>
        <p><strong>5th James & Marie Ovenden</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Neil Gessey & Jo Willis</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Over 50’s Pre/Champ Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Bruce & Susan Stephen</strong>.   Danced a good comp to-day, watch the poise and shoulder line.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Chris & Jenny Wherry</strong>.  I thought this couple had a good day to-day showing some better swing and movement throughout.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Steve Ewing & Roz Barber</strong>.  I got the impression they were slightly below par to-day.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Joe Smith & Veronica Jevons</strong>.  The opposition was just a little too strong on the day.</p>

        <h5>Senior Pre/Champ. Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Nicholas & Alison Gallagher – Hughes</strong>.   A nice easy couple now need more work from the standing leg to progress further.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd David & Jane Corby</strong>.  This couple have improved, particularly in the shoulder and arms area, but there is a distinct lack of body tone from the man.  You must work at straightening the back from the front toning.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Stephen Layland & Anita Stone</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>4th Yiping & Hong Song</strong>.  For me this couple need more attack but at the moment in an effort to do that the man is pulling the lady.  It is a team effort and you must both know where and when to push.</p>
        <p><strong>5th James Barnes & Georgina Falconer</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Over 35’s Waltz</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Robert Silver & Linda Lim</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Nicholas & Alison Gallagher – Hughes</strong>.  See Above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Simon Croydon – Fowler & Jo Hutchingson</strong>.  Looked the part but perhaps, because of their recent short lay off, a little bit ring rusty and tight to-day.</p>
        <p><strong>4th David & Jane Corby</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Stephen Layland & Anita Stone</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Yiping & Hong Song</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Over 35’s Foxtrot</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Robert Silver & Linda Lim</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Simon Croydon – Fowler & Jo Hutchingson</strong>.   See above.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Nicholas & Alison Gallagher – Hughes</strong>.   See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th David & Jane Corby</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Stephen Layland & Anita Stone</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Yiping & Hong Song</strong>.  See above.</p>

        <h5>Senior 2.  Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Simon Croydon – Fowler & Jo Hutchingson</strong>.   See above.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Patrick & Dorothy Lewis</strong>.  Easy soft dancing but I think you would benefit from looking at your setup.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Nicholas & Alison Gallagher – Hughes</strong>.   See above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Bruce & Susan Stephen</strong>.  See Above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Barry & Christine Jewis</strong>.  Easy moving couple but the man pulls his chin into his neck very firmly which affects the look of the top line.</p>
        <p><strong>6th Steve Ewing & Roz Barber</strong>.  See above.</p>
        <p><strong>7th David & Maddie Jefferys</strong>.  Very closed in at the top need to look at body toning.</p>

        <h5>Senior 3 Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Simon Croydon – Fowler & Jo Hutchingson</strong>.   A much more relaxed performance in this copmetition.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Patrick & Dorothy Lewis</strong>.  See above</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Bruce & Susan Stephen</strong>.  See Above.</p>
        <p><strong>4th Barry & Christine Jewis</strong>.    See Above.</p>
        <p><strong>5th Chris & Jenny Wherry</strong>.   See above.  </p>
        <p><strong>6th David & Maddie Jefferys</strong>.    See above.</p>
        <p><strong>7th Joe Smith & Veronica Jevons</strong>.   See above.</p>

        <h5>Open Quickstep</h5>

        <h5>Over 35’s Tango</h5>
        <p>An unbreakable tie for 3rd place.</p>

        <h5>Open Senior.  Waltz, Tango, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot & Quickstep</h5>
        <p><strong>1st Ian Sharp & Victoria Lawrence</strong>.  This couple, give the illusion that there is a mismatch in height when they dance that is not apparent when standing together.  I would suggest looking at the setup.</p>
        <p><strong>2nd Robert Silver & Linda Lim</strong>.  See above. Suspect timing in the V/Waltz.</p>
        <p><strong>3rd Patrick & Dorothy Lewis</strong>.  See above. </p>
